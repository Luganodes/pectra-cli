# Pectra CLI Validators Tool

![banner](https://i.imgur.com/7YKiU9D.png)

A powerful CLI tool for executing Ethereum validator operations including consolidation, switching, and both partial and full withdrawals with seamless batching enabled by EIP-7702.

# Background

The Pectra upgrade (Prague + Electra) introduces key validator enhancements: consolidation allows merging multiple validators into one to simplify management and reduce overhead; switch enables validators to update their BLS keys, supporting strategies like autocompounding without needing to exit and re-enter; and execution layer exits allow validators to exit directly via the execution layer, streamlining the exit process and enabling better integration with smart contracts and tooling.

This CLI leverages the Pectra.sol smart contract, designed to facilitate batch operations for Ethereum validator management tasks. It leverages EIP-7702 (Set EOA account code) to allow validator withdrawal Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to execute multiple operations (consolidation, credential switching, Execution Layer exits) in a single, atomic transaction.

This overcomes the limitation of the official Ethereum Foundation "system assembly" (sys-asm) contracts, which only permit one operation per transaction and require direct initiation by the withdrawal EOA.

## Features

- **Batch Switch**: Update withdrawal credentials for multiple validators from 0x01 type to 0x02 type in a single transaction.
- **Batch Consolidate**: Consolidate funds from multiple source validators to a single target validator in a single transaction.
- **Batch EL Exit**: Perform partial or full exits for multiple validators from the execution layer.
- **Secure**: Prompts for private key input securely at runtime; it's not stored in configuration files.
- **Dynamic Fee Calculation**: Automatically fetches required fees per validator from the smart contract.
- **Secure, audited contract**: The Pectra batch contract is open-source and has been independently audited by [Quantstamp](https://quantstamp.com). <br>

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Go (version 1.21+ recommended, as per `.github/workflows/release.yml` line 18) installed on your system.
2.  Clone the repository (if you haven't already).
3.  Build the CLI tool:

    ```bash
    go build -o pectra-cli ./cmd/main.go
    ```

    This will create an executable file named `pectra-cli` in the current directory.

## Configuration

Create a JSON configuration file named `config.json` in the same directory as the `pectra-cli` executable. You can use `sample_config.json` as a template.

**Example `config.json`:**

```json
{
  "rpcUrl": "http://100.71.214.23:8545",
  "blockExplorerUrl": "https://hoodi.etherscan.io",
  "pectraBatchContract": "0x209eF6e6d26953E30B652300Ac4a0A5De90f79F6",
  "switch": {
    "validators": [

    ],

      },

        "amount": 0,
        "confirmFullExit": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Fields:**

- `rpcUrl` (string): The URL of your Ethereum execution client RPC endpoint.
- `blockExplorerUrl` (string): The base URL for your preferred block explorer (e.g., `https://etherscan.io`). Used for displaying transaction links.
- `pectraBatchContract` (string): The address of the deployed Pectra batch contract.
- `switch.validators` (array of strings): A list of validator public keys (hexadecimal, no "0x" prefix) for the batch switch operation. Maximum source validators for switch: 200
- `consolidate.sourceValidators` (array of strings): A list of source validator public keys with 0x01 type withdrawal credentials for the batch consolidation operation. Maximum validators for consolidation: 63
- `consolidate.targetValidator` (string): The target validator public key for consolidation. Consolidated stake must be less than or equal to 2048 ETH otherwise surplus stake will get automatically sweeped.
- `elExit.validators` (object): A map where keys are validator public keys ( maximum of 200 ) and values are objects containing:
  - `amount` (number): The amount in **Gwei** to withdraw for a partial exit. For a full exit, set this to `0`.
  - `confirmFullExit` (boolean): Must be `true` if `amount` is `0` to confirm a full exit. Otherwise, `false` for partial exit and such an `amount` where remaining balance after the exit is at least 32 ETH.

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure only required validator addresses are set in config.json and their corresponding private keys are provided via the CLI ‚Äî missing or incorrect entries may result in unintended transfer of funds. <br><br>

## Private Key Handling

For security, your withdrawal address private key is **not** stored in the `config.json` file. The CLI will securely prompt you to enter it at runtime when an operation is initiated.
(See `internal/config/config.go` lines 88-114)

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that correct private keys are provided for the validators ‚Äî otherwise, transactions will succeed but no validator operation will occur, wasting gas. <br><br>

## üìú ABI Dependency

The CLI requires the Pectra batch contract's ABI. Place the `abi.json` file in the same directory as the `pectra-cli` executable.
(The ABI is loaded from `./abi.json` as seen in `cmd/main.go` line 49) <br><br>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Unset Delegation

> It is HIGHLY recommended to unset delegation after performing any operation. This helps with restoration of EOA functionality and prevents the address from being used as a smart contract.

To unset delegation for a validator, run:

```bash
./pectra-cli unset-delegation config.json
```

## Usage

The general command structure is:

```bash
./pectra-cli <command> config.json
```

To get a gist of the CLI, run:

```bash
./pectra-cli --help
```

Replace `<command>` with one of the operations listed below and `config.json` with the path to your configuration file.

### Switch Validators

Updates deposit credentials for the validators specified in `config.json` under the `switch` section. You can switch up to 200 validators in a single batch.

```bash
./pectra-cli switch config.json
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not switch a validator that has already been switched ‚Äî the transaction will succeed but the switch won't take effect, wasting gas. <br><br>

### Consolidate Validators

Consolidates funds from `sourceValidators` to `targetValidator` as specified in `config.json` under the `consolidate` section. You can consolidate from up to 63 source validators into one target validator.

```bash
./pectra-cli consolidate config.json
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use exited validators as source or target ‚Äî transactions will succeed but consolidation won't occur, wasting gas.<br><br>

### Execution Layer (EL) Exit

Performs partial or full exits for validators specified in `config.json` under the `elExit` section. You can exit up to 200 validators in a single batch.

```bash
./pectra-cli el-exit config.json
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not attempt to exit a validator that has already exited ‚Äî the transaction will succeed but no exit will occur, wasting gas. <br><br>

## üìù Important Notes

- **Validator Public Keys**: All validator public keys in the `config.json` file must be in hexadecimal format, without the "0x" prefix.
- **Transaction Fees**: The fee required per validator for each operation (switch, consolidate, EL exit) is automatically fetched from the smart contract functions (`getConsolidationFee`, `getExitFee`). This fee is in Wei. The total transaction `value` sent will be `(number of validators) * (fee per validator)`.
  (Fee fetching logic: `cmd/main.go` lines 67-74, 78-79, 91-92, 105-106) and `internal/utils/utils.go` lines 98-125
- **Execution Layer (EL) Exits**:
  - The `amount` specified in the `elExit.validators` section of `config.json` is in **Gwei** (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei).
    (See `internal/utils/utils.go` for usage notes, and `internal/operations/partialexit.go` lines 41-49 for handling)
  - For a **full exit**, set `amount` to `0` (or `0.0`) and `confirmFullExit` to `true`.
  - For a **partial exit**, specify the desired `amount` in Gwei (e.g., `10.0` for 10 Gwei) and ensure `confirmFullExit` is `false`.
- **Transaction Authorization**: This tool utilizes EIP-7702 SetCode transaction authorization for its operations.
  (See `internal/transaction/transaction.go` lines 18-61)
